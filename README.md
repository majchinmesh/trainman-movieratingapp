Node:

1. There is a postman export of all the requests to test them.
2. Im using Djangos native User model to handle all user related functions, I have extended it's functionality little bit.
3. Rest of the api's are as requested. Im only storing 3 fields for a movie, name, year and rating. 
4. There is a manytomany relation between users(account) and movies.
